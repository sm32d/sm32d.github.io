            <blockquote>
                Plagiarism is treated seriously. If we suspect any work is copied, all students
                involved are likely to receive zero for the entire assignment. Plagiarism
                has led to students being expelled from the University. <br>

                a situation like this, you may be eligible for Academic Consideration.
                Academic Consideration is designed to help students when they are sick, injured,
                or where a serious, unplanned situation has occurred that has affected their
                ability to study. <br>
